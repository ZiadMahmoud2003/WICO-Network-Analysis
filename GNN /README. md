# GNN Bot Detection Experiments

## 🤖 Overview

This directory contains code and experiments related to implementing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for **Node Classification**, specifically in the context of identifying suspicious users or bots within a social network graph.

The goal is to leverage the structural (graph) and feature information of users to classify them as either normal accounts or bots.

## 📁 Directory Structure

| File/Folder | Description |

| `README.md` | This file. |
| `Graph_Data_Prep.ipynb` | Code for preparing a **custom synthetic social graph** dataset, defining features, labels (normal vs. bot), and converting the structure into a PyTorch Geometric (PyG) `Data` object. |
| `Basic_GCN_Model.ipynb` | An example of training a **Simple Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** model for node classification on a standard benchmark dataset (Cora). This serves as a foundational GNN implementation. |

## 🛠️ Setup and Dependencies

This project relies on PyTorch and the PyTorch Geometric (PyG) library for efficient graph processing.

1.  **Install PyTorch and PyG:**
    ```bash
    # Assuming you have Python and pip installed
    # Install PyTorch (refer to PyTorch website for specific CUDA versions)
    # pip install torch

    # Install PyTorch Geometric (PyG) dependencies and the library itself
    !pip install torch_geometric
    ```
2.  **Other Libraries:**
    ```bash
    import networkx # Used for generating the custom graph structure
    ```

## 🚀 Key Experiments

### 1. Custom Data Creation (`PyG_Synthetic_Social_Graph.ipynb`)

This notebook demonstrates the crucial step of converting a conceptual graph structure (created using NetworkX) into the format required by PyTorch Geometric.

* **Graph Structure:** Contains two distinct clusters—a 'normal users community' and a 'suspicious cluster'.
* **Features (`x`):** One-hot encoding is used for basic node features.
* **Labels (`y`):** Nodes are labeled as `0` (normal) or `1` (bot).
* **Masks:** Defines simple `train_mask` and `test_mask` for future model evaluation.

### 2. GCN Baseline (`Basic_GCN_Model.ipynb`)

This notebook provides a working example of a Graph Neural Network implementation.

* **Dataset:** Uses the widely known **Cora** citation network dataset.
* **Model:** A simple two-layer GCN model (`SimpleGCN`) utilizing `GCNConv` layers.
* **Training:** Uses the standard Negative Log-Likelihood Loss (`F.nll_loss`) and Adam optimizer.
* **Result Example:** The output shows the model achieving a test accuracy (e.g., **0.75**) on the Cora dataset after 50 epochs.
